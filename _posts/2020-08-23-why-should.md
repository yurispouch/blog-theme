On that monumental year, L'Oreal completed the full acquisition of Style Nanda with a total of $152M (152,000,000 KRW). It was a massive event since no company has ever made such global acquisition before.

Why on earth global companies be interested in such an exotic brand, located on the opposite side of the glove?
